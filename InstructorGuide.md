## Introduction

This guide provides an industry-standard workflow for managing student assignments via GitHub. By following this approach, you will:
- Secure your main repository.
- Streamline assignment submissions.
- Provide in-line feedback.
- Maintain a clear version history.

## Core Workflow Overview

1. **Fork:**  
   Students fork your main repository to create their own copy.
2. **Branch:**  
   They work on assignments in dedicated branches within their fork.
3. **Pull Request:**  
   They submit their work via a Pull Request (PR) to your main repository.
4. **Review:**  
   You review the PR, provide feedback, and merge approved submissions.

**Benefits:**
- **Security:** Only you can push changes to the main repository.
- **Traceability:** Every submission has a clear history.
- **Collaboration:** In-line commenting and suggestions improve learning.

## Repository Setup and Configuration

### Initial Setup
1. **Repository Visibility:**
   - Navigate to your repository settings.
   - Set the repository to **Public**.
2. **Structure the Repository:**
   - Create a detailed `README.md` with course guidelines.
   - Organize assignment files into clearly named folders.
   - Include any necessary starter code or templates.

### Repository Organization Best Practices
```bash
python_course/
├── assignments/
│   ├── assignment1/
│   │   ├── README.md       # Assignment instructions and requirements
│   │   ├── starter_code/   # Starter files for students
│   │   └── tests/          # Automated tests (if applicable)
│   ├── assignment2/
│   └── ...
├── resources/
│   ├── submission_guide.md # Link to the Learner Guide
│   └── style_guide.md      # Coding and documentation style guidelines
└── README.md               # Course overview and submission process
```
