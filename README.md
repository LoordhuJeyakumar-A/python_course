# Python Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp (Job-Oriented)

**Welcome to the Git Repository for the Python Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp!**

This repository is your central resource for all materials related to the 8-week Python, Django, and MongoDB Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Whether you are a learner or revisiting the course, you will find comprehensive study materials, practical exercises, challenging assignments, daily tasks, and details about the capstone project here.

**Course Overview:**

This is an intensive, hands-on 8-week bootcamp designed to transform individuals with little to no prior programming experience into job-ready Python Full-Stack Web Developers. The curriculum focuses on practical skills and real-world applications, ensuring that learners gain the knowledge and abilities necessary to build complete web applications and succeed in the field.

We will cover a comprehensive range of technologies and concepts, including:

- **Python Fundamentals (Weeks 1-3):** Starting from the very basics, you will master core Python programming concepts, including syntax, data types, operators, control flow, data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets), functions, modules, packages, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- **Web Development Foundations & Django Framework (Weeks 4-6):** You will be introduced to web development fundamentals such as HTTP protocol and client-server architecture. You will then dive deep into the Django framework, learning to build web applications using models, views, templates, forms, URL configurations, and Django's powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). We will also explore user interaction and form handling in Django.
- **REST APIs with Django REST Framework & MongoDB (Week 7):** You will learn about RESTful API design and build robust APIs using Django REST Framework. We will also introduce NoSQL databases with MongoDB and learn how to integrate MongoDB with Python and Django applications.
- **Advanced Topics, Deployment & Capstone Project (Week 8):** The final week will cover advanced Django concepts, delve deeper into MongoDB, introduce the basics of deploying web applications, and kick off the capstone project. This project serves as a culmination of all learned skills and a significant portfolio piece.
- **Version Control with Git:** Throughout the bootcamp, you will use Git and GitHub for version control, collaboration, and managing your code effectively.

**Repository Structure Details:**

This repository is organized to provide you with all the necessary learning materials in a structured and easy-to-navigate manner. Here's a breakdown of the folder structure:

- **`week_1/`**, **`week_2/`**, ..., **`week_8/`**: These folders represent each week of the bootcamp. Inside each week's folder, you'll find:

  - **`notes/`**: This folder contains Markdown files (`.md`) for each day of the week's lectures and study materials. For example, in `week_1/notes/`, you will find files like `day_1_introduction.md`, `day_2_variables_datatypes.md`, and so on. These files are your primary source of learning material for each topic.
  - **`exercises/`**: This folder contains Python files (`.py`) with practice exercises for each day's topic. For some conceptual days, you might find text files (`.txt`) outlining exercises or thought problems. These exercises are designed to reinforce your understanding of the daily lessons. Example filenames: `day_2_exercises.py`, `day_3_exercises.py`, `day_4_exercises.py`, etc.
  - **`assignments/`**: This folder contains weekly assignments, typically Python files (`.py`) or text descriptions (`.txt`), designed to test your overall grasp of the week's concepts and challenge you to apply your knowledge to more significant problems. Example filenames: `week_1_assignment.py`, `week_2_assignment.py`, etc.

- **`capstone_project/`**: This folder is dedicated to the final Capstone Project that you will work on.

  - **`project_description.md`**: This file provides a comprehensive description of the Capstone Project, including its goals, required features, and guidelines. It's your go-to document to understand the project scope.
  - **`initial_setup_guide.md` (Optional)**: In some cases, this file might be included to provide initial setup instructions or starter code for the Capstone Project, if applicable.

- **`daily_tasks/`**: This folder contains Markdown files listing simple daily tasks for each week. These tasks are quick exercises designed to reinforce the day's learning in a practical way. For example, `week_1_tasks.md`, `week_2_tasks.md`, etc., will list the daily tasks for each respective week.

- **`README.md`**: You are currently reading this file! It's the main entry point to this repository and provides an overview of the bootcamp and how to use this repository effectively.

- **`LICENSE` (Optional)**: This file, if present, will contain the license information for this repository. It specifies the terms and conditions under which the bootcamp materials are made available. (If a LICENSE file is present, please refer to it for licensing details).

**How to Use This Repository:**

To make the most of this bootcamp and repository, follow these steps:

1.  **Start with the `README.md`**: Always begin by reading the `README.md` file in the root directory to get a general overview of the bootcamp structure and repository organization.
2.  **Navigate to the Week Folders**: As you progress through the bootcamp week by week, navigate to the corresponding `week_1/`, `week_2/`, etc., folders.
3.  **Study the `notes/`**: Within each week's folder, start by studying the notes in the `notes/` directory. Open the Markdown files (`.md`) corresponding to each day (e.g., `day_1_introduction.md`). These notes contain the core concepts, explanations, and examples for each day's topic. Use a Markdown viewer (like in VS Code, GitHub, GitLab, or online Markdown viewers) for optimal readability.
4.  **Practice with `exercises/`**: After studying the notes for a day, move to the `exercises/` folder for that week and find the exercise files (e.g., `day_2_exercises.py`). Try to solve these exercises yourself to solidify your understanding of the concepts. Solutions may be provided separately by your instructor after you have attempted the exercises.
5.  **Complete Weekly `assignments/`**: At the end of each week, tackle the weekly assignment found in the `assignments/` folder (e.g., `week_1_assignment.py`). These assignments are more comprehensive and designed to challenge you to apply the week's learning to build small programs or solve more complex problems.
6.  **Review `daily_tasks/`**: Refer to the `daily_tasks/` folder, specifically the file for the current week (e.g., `week_1_tasks.md`), to see the list of simple daily tasks. These tasks are designed for quick practice and reinforcement of daily concepts.
7.  **Capstone Project in `capstone_project/`**: In Week 8, and potentially beyond, you will work on the Capstone Project. Find the `project_description.md` file in the `capstone_project/` folder to understand the project requirements and start planning your project.
8.  **Use Git for Version Control**: Throughout the bootcamp, it's highly recommended to use Git to track your progress, manage your code, and collaborate (if applicable). Clone this repository, create your own branches for assignments and project work, commit your changes regularly, and push them to your own remote repository.
