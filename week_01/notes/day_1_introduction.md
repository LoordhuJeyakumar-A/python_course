## **Study Material & Notes**

### **What is Python?**

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility.

- **High-level**: Closer to human language, making it easier to read and write.
- **General-purpose**: Used in web development, data science, automation, and more.
- **Interpreted**: Executes code line by line, eliminating the need for compilation.
- **Dynamically Typed**: No need to declare variable types explicitly.
- **Large Standard Library**: Provides built-in modules for various functionalities.

### **Why Learn Python?**

- Beginner-friendly syntax.
- Wide-ranging applications.
- Large community and extensive resources.
- High demand in the job market.

### **Applications of Python**

- **Web Development**: Django, Flask.
- **Data Science & AI**: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow.
- **Scripting & Automation**: Automating tasks.
- **Game Development**: Pygame.
- **Desktop Applications**: Tkinter, PyQt.

## **Setting Up Python Environment**

### **Step 1: Install Python**

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install it and **check "Add Python to PATH"** during installation.
3. Verify installation by running:
   ```sh
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

### **Step 2: Install an IDE**

Recommended IDEs:

- **VS Code** ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) - Install the Python extension.
- **PyCharm** ([Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)) - Community Edition is free.

## **Your First Python Program: "Hello, World!"**

1. Open your IDE and create a new file (`hello.py`).
2. Write the following code:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
3. Run the program:
   - **VS Code**: Click "Run Python File in Terminal" or press `F5`.
   - **PyCharm**: Right-click and select "Run 'hello.py'".

### **Expected Output:**

```
Hello, World!
```

---

## **Basic Python Syntax**

### **Indentation**

Python uses indentation instead of braces `{}`.

```python
if True:
    print("Indented code block")
print("Not indented")
```

### **Comments**

- **Single-line comments**: `# This is a comment`
- **Multi-line comments (docstrings)**:
  ```python
  """
  This is a multi-line comment
  or a docstring.
  """
  ```
